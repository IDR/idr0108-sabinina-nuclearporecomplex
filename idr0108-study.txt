Study Title	3D super-resolution fluorescence microscopy maps the variable molecular architecture of the Nuclear Pore Complex			
Study Type	time-lapse imaging

Study Type Term Accession	OMIT_0027490			
Study Description	We explored the power of 3D super-resolution microscopy combined with computational classification and averaging to explore the 3D structure of the NPC in single human cells. We show that this approach can build the first integrated 3D structural map containing both central as well as peripheral NPC subunits with molecular specificity and nanoscale resolution. Our unbiased classification of over ten thousand individual NPCs indicates that the nuclear ring and the nuclear basket can adopt different conformations. Our approach opens up the exciting possibility to relate different structural states of the NPC to function in situ.

Protocol Type Term Accession	EFO_0003789	EFO_0003969		
Protocol Description	U2OS cells were cultured at 37C and 5% CO2 in 1x high glucose McCoy's 5A modified medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1% MEM nonessential amino acid. Tests confirming the absence of mycoplasma were performed every 2 months.	The nucleoporin gene of interest was edited with the SNAPf-tag Zinc finger nucleases to add a SNAP tag at the N-terminus of the protein. Tagged proteins were detected using benzylguanine-conjugated AF647 and ELYS with a polyclonal rabbit antibody followed by a secondary antibody coupled to CF680. Data was acquired on a custom-built wide-field setup described in Deschamps et al., 2016 using a cylindrical lens (f = 1000 mm) to introduce astigmatism. 		Blinking event data (files with names MMStack*.ome.tif)  was processed to generate localization data (in csv files) which was further processed to produce the final images (files with names sml_3Dvolume*.tif). Processing was done with the SMAP software (https://github.com/jries/SMAP)
